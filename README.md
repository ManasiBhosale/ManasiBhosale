</p>

A curious coder, data and machine learning enthusiast, and lifelong learner who loves turning complex problems into smart, scalable solutions. I recently earned my MSc in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Manchester (2:1 with Distinction in Data Engineering and Text Mining), and Iâ€™m currently helping train the next generation of AI at Outlier.

With experience as a Senior Data Engineer and a strong foundation in Python, PySpark, and SQL, Iâ€™ve built everything from movie recommender systems and stock analysis dashboards to deep learning-powered plant classifiers. My work blends technical depth with creativityâ€”whether itâ€™s optimising pipelines or crafting AI training tasks that push large language models to think harder.

### ðŸ”­ Currently Working On:
- Enhancing generative AI modelsâ€™ reasoning through code prompt design & evaluation at Outlier.
- Contributing to NLP data annotation pipelines to improve model performance.
- Keeping my Python game sharp through fun side projects.

### ðŸŒ± Always Learning:
- Power BI (just earned some shiny Microsoft badges!)
- Representation learning, LLM prompting, and visual data processing.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About:
- How to make your Python scripts run 95% faster (yep, done it).
- Data engineering for ML workflows.
- How to survive both hackathons and AI model evaluations.
### ðŸ”— Projects & Demos

- ðŸŽ¬ **Movie Recommendation System**  
  A personalized movie recommendation website using cosine similarity, processing 100K+ ratings for 1,700+ movies.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once built a plant ID app that placed top 50 out of 600+ entriesâ€”using deep learning and a whole lot of curiosity ðŸŒ¿

Thanks for stopping by!
